[Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/) in .NET 8

## Day 1

Humbling, tripped up by not recognizing the double number requirement for a single digit found.

## Day 2

Not happy with the code, seems a bit hacky.

## Day 3

Refactoring to use LINQ was pretty cool, but still think there is a better way to do this.  Trying to remember if there is a better way with Point[x,y] comparisons to simplify the LINQ expressions.

Part 2 went pretty quick after figuring out part 1's LINQ.

## Day 4

Part 1 was a bit tricky, sad to admit but C# really helped here.  Knowing HasSet had Intersection() was a time saver.
